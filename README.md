# Sudoku

Sudoku is a project developed during the Agile Software Development for Enterprises course held in 2018 at the University of Calabria.
It is a demonstration of a simple application of the tecnhology studied, i.e. Java EE, Spring, Hibernates, and many more.

This repository contains an actual stable version of our implementation of the Sudoku classical game.

It is composed of several interfaces:

## Playing a match

A match is hosted by one of the players, who has the permission to start it as soon as an opponent join the room.

Not all the matches are similar, in fact you may choose the difficulty most fit to your skills and a random map will be generated .This map is unique and solvable.

Select a cell and insert a number. A visual assistant will help you to understand what values you already chose.

Notice that you can monitor your opponents thanks a progress bar located below the game board.



## The history

All your history is mantained and, therefore, we can use that knowledge to measure your performances.

The dashboard is a perfect place for this: you can visualize the ratios of each outcomes based on the match difficulty.
